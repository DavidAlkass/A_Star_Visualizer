## About the project
- The project itself is not an original idea, needless to say i was inspired by a bunch of talented people who had already done this.
- However, under the influence and guidance of similar projects and their creators i was able to gain a deeper understanding for the algorithm whilst honing my skills in programming and problem solving. 

### Short description
- In short, A* is an informed pathfinding algorithm. It functions as a means to find the shortest path from point A to point B. It sort of operates by keeping track of all its visited nodes and their distances to the point B. By doing this the algorithm can constantly make an informed decition whether to keep moving in a certain direction or return to a previous node which is now closer to B than our current position. 
- In conclusion this leads to much shorter traversal through said graph in order to find our shortest path.
